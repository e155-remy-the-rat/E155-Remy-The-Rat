This is the repository for Alisha and Marina's code for their final project for E155-Microprocessor Systems, which is building a real life system
imitating Remy the Rat from Ratatouille. The system will integrate two IMUs while controlling two servo motors and communicate using I2C and RF, using an upDuino FPGA and a STM32 microcontroller to implement this design.
